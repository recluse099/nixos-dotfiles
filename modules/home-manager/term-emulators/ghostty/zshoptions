[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Zsh  is  a  UNIX  command  interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive login shell and as a
       shell script command processor.  Of the standard shells, zsh most closely resembles [1mksh  [22mbut
       includes many enhancements.  It does not provide compatibility with POSIX or other shells in
       its default operating mode:  see the section `Compatibility' below.

       Zsh  has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable command completion,
       shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a host of other features.

[1mAUTHOR[0m
       Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad.  Zsh is now maintained by  the  members  of  the
       zsh-workers mailing list [1m<zsh-workers@zsh.org>[22m.  The development is currently coordinated by
       Peter  Stephenson [1m<pws@zsh.org>[22m.  The coordinator can be contacted at [1m<coordinator@zsh.org>[22m,
       but matters relating to the code should generally go to the mailing list.

[1mTHE ZSH USERGUIDE[0m
       A userguide is currently in preparation.  It is intended to complement the manual, with  ex‐
       planations  and  hints on issues where the manual can be cabbalistic, hierographic, or down‐
       right mystifying (for example, the word `hierographic' does not exist).  It can be viewed in
       its current state at [1mhttps://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/[22m.  At the time  of  writing,  chapters
       dealing with startup files and their contents and the new completion system were essentially
       complete.

[1mINVOCATION[0m
       The  following  flags are interpreted by the shell when invoked to determine where the shell
       will read commands from:

       [1m-c     [22mTake the first argument as a command to execute, rather than reading commands from  a
              script  or  standard input.  If any further arguments are given, the first one is as‐
              signed to [1m$0[22m, rather than being used as a positional parameter.

       [1m-i     [22mForce shell to be interactive.  It is still possible to specify a script to execute.

       [1m-s     [22mForce shell to read commands from the standard input.  If the [1m-s [22mflag is not  present
              and  an argument is given, the first argument is taken to be the pathname of a script
              to execute.

       If there are any remaining arguments after option processing, and neither of the options  [1m-c[0m
       or  [1m-s  [22mwas  supplied,  the  first argument is taken as the file name of a script containing
       shell commands to be executed.  If the option [1mPATH_SCRIPT [22mis set, and the file name does not
       contain a directory path (i.e. there is no `[1m/[22m' in the name), first the current directory and
       then the command path given by the variable [1mPATH [22mare searched for the script.  If the option
       is not set or the file name contains a `[1m/[22m' it is used directly.

       After the first one or two arguments have been appropriated as described above, the  remain‐
       ing arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.

       For further options, which are common to invocation and the [1mset [22mbuiltin, see [4mzshoptions[24m(1).

       The long option `[1m--emulate[22m' followed (in a separate word) by an emulation mode may be passed
       to  the  shell.   The  emulation modes are those described for the [1memulate [22mbuiltin, see [4mzsh‐[0m
       [4mbuiltins[24m(1).  The `[1m--emulate[22m' option must precede any other options (which  might  otherwise
       be  overridden),  but following options are honoured, so may be used to modify the requested
       emulation mode.  Note that certain extra steps are taken to ensure a smooth  emulation  when
       this  option  is used compared with the [1memulate [22mcommand within the shell: for example, vari‐
       ables that conflict with POSIX usage such as [1mpath [22mare not defined within the shell.

       Options may be specified by name using the [1m-o [22moption.  [1m-o [22macts like a single-letter  option,
       but takes a following string as the option name.  For example,

              [1mzsh -x -o shwordsplit scr[0m

       runs  the  script  [1mscr[22m,  setting  the [1mXTRACE [22moption by the corresponding letter `[1m-x[22m' and the
       [1mSH_WORD_SPLIT [22moption by name.  Options may be turned [4moff[24m by name by using [1m+o [22minstead of  [1m-o[22m.
       [1m-o  [22mcan be stacked up with preceding single-letter options, so for example `[1m-xo shwordsplit[22m'
       or `[1m-xoshwordsplit[22m' is equivalent to `[1m-x -o shwordsplit[22m'.

       Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option style, `[1m--[4m[22moption-name[24m'.  When  this
       is  done, `[1m-[22m' characters in the option name are permitted: they are translated into `[1m_[22m', and
       thus ignored.  So, for example, `[1mzsh --sh-word-split[22m' invokes zsh with the [1mSH_WORD_SPLIT [22mop‐
       tion turned on.  Like other option syntaxes, options can be turned off by replacing the ini‐
       tial `[1m-[22m' with a `[1m+[22m'; thus `[1m+-sh-word-split[22m' is equivalent to  `[1m--no-sh-word-split[22m'.   Unlike
       other  option  syntaxes, GNU-style long options cannot be stacked with any other options, so
       for example `[1m-x-shwordsplit[22m' is an error, rather than being treated like `[1m-x --shwordsplit[22m'.

       The special GNU-style option `[1m--version[22m' is handled; it sends to standard output the shell's
       version information, then exits successfully.  `[1m--help[22m' is also handled; it sends  to  stan‐
       dard  output a list of options that can be used when invoking the shell, then exits success‐
       fully.

       Option processing may be finished, allowing following arguments that start with `[1m-[22m'  or  `[1m+[22m'
       to be treated as normal arguments, in two ways.  Firstly, a lone `[1m-[22m' (or `[1m+[22m') as an argument
       by  itself  ends option processing.  Secondly, a special option `[1m--[22m' (or `[1m+-[22m'), which may be
       specified on its own (which is the standard POSIX usage) or may be  stacked  with  preceding
       options  (so `[1m-x-[22m' is equivalent to `[1m-x --[22m').  Options are not permitted to be stacked after
       `[1m--[22m' (so `[1m-x-f[22m' is an error), but note the GNU-style  option  form  discussed  above,  where
       `[1m--shwordsplit[22m' is permitted and does not end option processing.

       Except  when  the  [1msh[22m/[1mksh [22memulation single-letter options are in effect, the option `[1m-b[22m' (or
       `[1m+b[22m') ends option processing.  `[1m-b[22m' is like `[1m--[22m', except that further single-letter  options
       can be stacked after the `[1m-b[22m' and will take effect as normal.

[1mCOMPATIBILITY[0m
       Zsh tries to emulate [1msh [22mor [1mksh [22mwhen it is invoked as [1msh [22mor [1mksh [22mrespectively; more precisely,
       it  looks at the first letter of the name by which it was invoked, excluding any initial `[1mr[22m'
       (assumed to stand for `restricted'), and if that is `[1mb[22m', `[1ms[22m' or `[1mk[22m' it will  emulate  [1msh  [22mor
       [1mksh[22m.  Furthermore, if invoked as [1msu [22m(which happens on certain systems when the shell is exe‐
       cuted  by the [1msu [22mcommand), the shell will try to find an alternative name from the [1mSHELL [22men‐
       vironment variable and perform emulation based on that.

       In [1msh [22mand [1mksh [22mcompatibility modes the following parameters are not special and not  initial‐
       ized  by  the  shell: [1mARGC[22m, [1margv[22m, [1mcdpath[22m, [1mfignore[22m, [1mfpath[22m, [1mHISTCHARS[22m, [1mmailpath[22m, [1mMANPATH[22m, [1mman‐[0m
       [1mpath[22m, [1mpath[22m, [1mprompt[22m, [1mPROMPT[22m, [1mPROMPT2[22m, [1mPROMPT3[22m, [1mPROMPT4[22m, [1mpsvar[22m, [1mstatus[22m.

       The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed.  Login shells  source  [1m/etc/profile[0m
       followed  by  [1m$HOME/.profile[22m.  If the [1mENV [22menvironment variable is set on invocation, [1m$ENV [22mis
       sourced after the profile scripts.  The value of [1mENV [22mis subjected  to  parameter  expansion,
       command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname.  Note
       that the [1mPRIVILEGED [22moption also affects the execution of startup files.

       The  following  options  are  set  if  the  shell  is  invoked as [1msh [22mor [1mksh[22m: [1mNO_BAD_PATTERN[22m,
       [1mNO_BANG_HIST[22m,  [1mNO_BG_NICE[22m,  [1mNO_EQUALS[22m,  [1mNO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO[22m,  [1mGLOB_SUBST[22m,  [1mNO_GLOBAL_EXPORT[22m,
       [1mNO_HUP[22m, [1mINTERACTIVE_COMMENTS[22m, [1mKSH_ARRAYS[22m, [1mNO_MULTIOS[22m, [1mNO_NOMATCH[22m, [1mNO_NOTIFY[22m, [1mPOSIX_BUILTINS[22m,
       [1mNO_PROMPT_PERCENT[22m,    [1mRM_STAR_SILENT[22m,    [1mSH_FILE_EXPANSION[22m,    [1mSH_GLOB[22m,   [1mSH_OPTION_LETTERS[22m,
       [1mSH_WORD_SPLIT[22m.  Additionally the [1mBSD_ECHO [22mand [1mIGNORE_BRACES [22moptions are set if  zsh  is  in‐
       voked  as [1msh[22m.  Also, the [1mKSH_OPTION_PRINT[22m, [1mLOCAL_OPTIONS[22m, [1mPROMPT_BANG[22m, [1mPROMPT_SUBST [22mand [1mSIN‐[0m
       [1mGLE_LINE_ZLE [22moptions are set if zsh is invoked as [1mksh[22m.

       Please note that, whilst reasonable efforts are taken to address incompatibilities when they
       arise, zsh does not guarantee complete emulation of other shells, nor POSIX compliance.  For
       more  information on the differences between zsh and other shells, please refer to chapter 2
       of the shell FAQ, [1mhttps://www.zsh.org/FAQ/[22m.

[1mRESTRICTED SHELL[0m
       When the basename of the command used to invoke zsh starts with the letter `[1mr[22m' or  the  `[1m-r[22m'
       command line option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes restricted.  Emulation mode
       is  determined  after  stripping the letter `[1mr[22m' from the invocation name.  The following are
       disabled in restricted mode:

       •      changing directories with the [1mcd [22mbuiltin

       •      changing or unsetting the [1mEGID[22m,  [1mEUID[22m,  [1mGID[22m,  [1mHISTFILE[22m,  [1mHISTSIZE[22m,  [1mIFS[22m,  [1mLD_AOUT_LI‐[0m
              [1mBRARY_PATH[22m,  [1mLD_AOUT_PRELOAD[22m,  [1mLD_LIBRARY_PATH[22m, [1mLD_PRELOAD[22m, [1mMODULE_PATH[22m, [1mmodule_path[22m,
              [1mPATH[22m, [1mpath[22m, [1mSHELL[22m, [1mUID [22mand [1mUSERNAME [22mparameters

       •      specifying command names containing [1m/[0m

       •      specifying command pathnames using [1mhash[0m

       •      redirecting output to files

       •      using the [1mexec [22mbuiltin command to replace the shell with another command

       •      using [1mjobs -Z [22mto overwrite the shell process' argument and environment space

       •      using the [1mARGV0 [22mparameter to override [1margv[0] [22mfor external commands

       •      turning off restricted mode with [1mset +r [22mor [1munsetopt RESTRICTED[0m

       These restrictions are enforced after processing  the  startup  files.   The  startup  files
       should  set  up  [1mPATH [22mto point to a directory of commands which can be safely invoked in the
       restricted environment.  They may  also  add  further  restrictions  by  disabling  selected
       builtins.

       Restricted mode can also be activated any time by setting the [1mRESTRICTED [22moption.  This imme‐
       diately  enables  all  the  restrictions  described  above  even  if the shell still has not
       processed all startup files.

       A shell [4mRestricted[24m [4mMode[24m is an outdated way to restrict what users may  do:   modern  systems
       have  better,  safer  and  more reliable ways to confine user actions, such as [4mchroot[24m [4mjails[24m,
       [4mcontainers[24m and [4mzones[24m.

       A restricted shell is very difficult to implement safely.  The feature may be removed  in  a
       future version of zsh.

       It  is  important  to realise that the restrictions only apply to the shell, not to the com‐
       mands it runs (except for some shell builtins).  While a restricted shell can only  run  the
       restricted  list of commands accessible via the predefined `[1mPATH[22m' variable, it does not pre‐
       vent those commands from running any other command.

       As an example, if `[1menv[22m' is among the list of [4mallowed[24m commands, then it allows  the  user  to
       run any command as `[1menv[22m' is not a shell builtin command and can run arbitrary executables.

       So  when implementing a restricted shell framework it is important to be fully aware of what
       actions each of the [4mallowed[24m commands or features (which may be regarded as [4mmodules[24m) can per‐
       form.

       Many commands can have their behaviour affected by environment variables.   Except  for  the
       few listed above, zsh does not restrict the setting of environment variables.

       If  a  `[1mperl[22m', `[1mpython[22m', `[1mbash[22m', or other general purpose interpreted script it treated as a
       restricted command, the user can work around the restriction by  setting  specially  crafted
       `[1mPERL5LIB[22m',  `[1mPYTHONPATH[22m',  `[1mBASHENV[22m' (etc.) environment variables. On GNU systems, any com‐
       mand can be made to run arbitrary code when performing character set  conversion  (including
       zsh itself) by setting a `[1mGCONV_PATH[22m' environment variable.  Those are only a few examples.

       Bear  in  mind  that, contrary to some other shells, `[1mreadonly[22m' is not a security feature in
       zsh as it can be undone and so cannot be used to mitigate the above.

       A restricted shell only works if the allowed commands are few and carefully  written  so  as
       not  to grant more access to users than intended.  It is also important to restrict what zsh
       module the user  may  load  as  some  of  them,  such  as  `[1mzsh/system[22m',  `[1mzsh/mapfile[22m'  and
       `[1mzsh/files[22m', allow bypassing most of the restrictions.

[1mSTARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES[0m
       Commands  are  first read from [1m/etc/zshenv[22m; this cannot be overridden.  Subsequent behaviour
       is modified by the [1mRCS [22mand [1mGLOBAL_RCS [22moptions; the former affects all startup  files,  while
       the  second only affects global startup files (those shown here with an path starting with a
       [1m/[22m).  If one of the options is unset at any point, any subsequent startup file(s) of the cor‐
       responding type will not be read.  It is also possible for a file in [1m$ZDOTDIR  [22mto  re-enable
       [1mGLOBAL_RCS[22m. Both [1mRCS [22mand [1mGLOBAL_RCS [22mare set by default.

       Commands  are  then read from [1m$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv[22m.  If the shell is a login shell, commands are
       read from [1m/etc/zprofile [22mand then [1m$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile[22m.  Then, if  the  shell  is  interactive,
       commands  are read from [1m/etc/zshrc [22mand then [1m$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc[22m.  Finally, if the shell is a lo‐
       gin shell, [1m/etc/zlogin [22mand [1m$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin [22mare read.

       When a login shell exits, the files [1m$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout [22mand then [1m/etc/zlogout [22mare read.   This
       happens with either an explicit exit via the [1mexit [22mor [1mlogout [22mcommands, or an implicit exit by
       reading end-of-file from the terminal.  However, if the shell terminates due to [1mexec[22m'ing an‐
       other  process,  the  logout  files  are  not  read.  These are also affected by the [1mRCS [22mand
       [1mGLOBAL_RCS [22moptions.  Note also that the [1mRCS [22moption affects the saving of history files, i.e.
       if [1mRCS [22mis unset when the shell exits, no history file will be saved.

       If [1mZDOTDIR [22mis unset, [1mHOME [22mis used instead.  Files listed above as being in [1m/etc  [22mmay  be  in
       another directory, depending on the installation.

       As  [1m/etc/zshenv [22mis run for all instances of zsh, it is important that it be kept as small as
       possible.  In particular, it is a good idea to put code that does not need  to  be  run  for
       every single shell behind a test of the form `[1mif [[ -o rcs ]]; then ...[22m' so that it will not
       be executed when zsh is invoked with the `[1m-f[22m' option.

       Any  of  these  files  may  be  pre-compiled  with  the  [1mzcompile  [22mbuiltin command (see [4mzsh‐[0m
       [4mbuiltins[24m(1)).  If a compiled file exists (named for the original file plus the  [1m.zwc  [22mexten‐
       sion) and it is newer than the original file, the compiled file will be used instead.
